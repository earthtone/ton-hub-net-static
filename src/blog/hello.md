### Why build static site?

I'm a child of the 90s. I belong to the first generation that actually grew up *with* the web. As much as I love to wax nostalgic about [web rings](https://ourspace.neocities.org/), [e-mail groups](http://hyperreal.org/), and the sound 56K modems used to make, I have to admit things were pretty rough back then.

For me, the web really hit its golden age in the early 2000s with the idea of [Web 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0). Today we take it for granted, but social networks like Friendster, cloud hosting services like Flickr, and of course blogging platforms like Live Journal really paved the way for what the web has become today.

However, as a professional web developer my day-to-day life is spent swimming in the vast ocean of hip, modern, single-page, progressive, mobile-first ecma-goodness scaled across all vectors for maximum uni-directional code-split.

As someone who learned the basics of web development clicking `VIEW SOURCE` in my browser's menu, I miss how simple and straighforward building websites used to be. When it came to building my own site, I wanted to take back that sense of play and fun that made me fall in love with computers as a kid.

Along with increasing the richness and complexity of the web, the Web 2.0 days also brought us a lot of great technology that remains at the core of the modern web. Concepts like [AJAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)), a [modular CSS spec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#CSS_2.1), and [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) all came out of the web's akward teen years as it was just figuring itself out.

As I get older I find there are [a few things from my youth](https://www.discogs.com/Dropdead-Dropdead/master/232096) like these technologies that might appear raw and primitive compared to what is available today, but my appreciation for their raw power and lack of pretence deepens the more I revisit them.

Imagine how gassed I was when I first heard about [the JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/). It was like someone finally gave me permission to build simple things simply, withouth sacrificing any of the elegance of modern web development.

[Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) is a "framework" for building web applications in the truest sense I can think of. While it's powered by [VueJS](http://vuejs.org/), a powerful library/framework for building web applications on its own, what Nuxt really brings to the table are its opinions.

Nuxt is capable of [building quite a few things in a few different ways](https://twitter.com/hecktarzuli/status/1071438919781281792), but one of my favorite features is the [generate property](https://nuxtjs.org/api/configuration-generate/). This useful tool lets me use my complex JavaScript app, full of node modules and reusuable Vue components, to build a simple, straight-forward static site.

Without opening your browser's developer tools, you can simply right-click on this page to view its HTML source. How cool is that?

That functionality has been a core part of what makes the web since I was a kid. It's what enabled me to become a professional web developer. Its something I hope stays etched into the DNA of whatever form the web takes in the future.
