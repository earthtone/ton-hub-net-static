With a few years experience using HTML5 and Sass/CSS to implement UI, I've grown into a role that focuses primarily on the architecture and engineering of JavaScript heavy web applications, using a variety of tooling and frameworks. Being an active devotee of the open source community, Iâ€™ve developed a passion for optimizing workflows, testing and following best practices to deliver clean, clear, and maintainable code that not only performs for users, but communicates intention and purpose across development teams."
